1. User Requests a URL:

    The user enters the URL www.foobar.com in the browser's search bar.
2. Domain Name System (DNS) Resolution:

    The browser contacts the Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve the URL (www.foobar.com) into an IP address. The DNS server responds with the IP address (8.8.8.8) of the web server that hosts the website.
    Request Sent to Web Server:

    The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server (e.g., Nginx server at 8.8.8.8).
3. Web Server Determines Content Type:

    The web server checks whether the requested content is static (like HTML, CSS, or images) or dynamic (generated by the application server).
    If the content is static, the web server retrieves it from its storage and sends it directly back to the browser.
    If the content is dynamic, the web server forwards the request to the application server (e.g., Flask server).
4. Application Server Handles Dynamic Content:

    The application server (Flask) processes the request and queries the MySQL database for any required data.
5. Database Query:

    The MySQL database executes the query and sends the requested data back to the application server.

6. Data Sent to Web Server:

    The application server uses the data to generate the dynamic content and sends it back to the web server.

7. Web Server Responds to Client:

    Finally, the web server sends the generated dynamic content (or static content) back to the user's browser.
