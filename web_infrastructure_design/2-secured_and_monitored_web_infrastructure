1. User Browser:
    The user enters https://www.foobar.com in the browser.

2. DNS Resolution:
    The DNS resolves the URL to the IP address of the HAProxy server.

3. Firewall 1 (External Firewall):
    The request first goes through Firewall 1 to filter out any malicious traffic.

4. HAProxy Load Balancer:
    HAProxy receives the filtered request from Firewall 1.

5. SSL Termination:
     If the request is HTTPS, it will be encrypted; otherwise, it will be HTTP.

6. Forwarding: 
    HAProxy forwards the request to one of the Web Servers (Nginx).
7. Firewall 2 (Web Server Firewall):
    The request passes through Firewall 2 to ensure only traffic from HAProxy reaches the Web Server.

8. Web Server (Nginx) with SSL Certificate:
    The Web Server (Nginx):

    Handles the SSL termination (if the request is encrypted).
    Checks if the request is for static or dynamic content.
    If it's static content, Nginx serves it directly.
    If it's dynamic content, Nginx forwards the request to the Application Server (Flask).

9. Firewall 3 (Application Server Firewall):
    The request goes through Firewall 3, filtering traffic to the Application Server.

10. Application Server (Flask):

    The Application Server processes the dynamic request, queries the MySQL Database, and returns the data back to the Web Server (Nginx).

11. Web Server (Nginx):

    Receives the dynamic response from the Application Server.
    Forwards the combined content (static and dynamic) back to HAProxy.

12. HAProxy:

    HAProxy receives the response and forwards it back to the user's browser.

13. User Browser:

    The user's browser receives the final response and renders the content.

14. Monitoring Clients:

    Each component (HAProxy, Web Server, Application Server) has its own monitoring client to collect and send metrics and logs to a monitoring service for performance and security monitoring.
